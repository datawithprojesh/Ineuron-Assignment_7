    "#### Answer:\n",
    "(i) The operators '/' and '//' represent division in Python, but they behave differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "    '/' (forward slash) is the regular division operator. When used between two numbers, it performs floating-point division and returns a floating-point result, even if the result is a whole number.\n",
    "    For example: 7 / 2 = 3.5\n",
    "\n",
    "    '//' (double forward slash) is the floor division operator. It performs integer division and returns the largest whole number that is less than or equal to the division result.\n",
    "    For example: 7 // 2 = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) The operators '**' and '^' represent exponentiation or raising a number to a power, but they have different meanings:\n",
    "\n",
    "    '**' (double asterisk) is the exponentiation operator in Python. It calculates the power of a number by raising it to the given exponent.\n",
    "    For example: 2 ** 3 = 8\n",
    "\n",
    "    '^' (caret) is not an exponentiation operator in Python. It is commonly used as the XOR (exclusive OR) operator in some programming languages, but not in Python. In Python, the '^' operator is the bitwise XOR operator, which performs a bitwise XOR operation between two integers.\n",
    "    For example: 5 ^ 3 = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize:\n",
    "\n",
    "    '/' performs floating-point division.\n",
    "    '//' performs integer division (floor division).\n",
    "    '**' performs exponentiation.\n",
    "    '^' is not an exponentiation operator in Python; it is the bitwise XOR operator."

    "The right shift (>>) and left shift (<<) operators are bitwise shift operators in Python. They are used to shift the bits of a binary number to the right or left, respectively.\n",

    "- The right shift operator (>>) moves the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions. It effectively divides the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift amount. The rightmost bits are discarded, and zeros are added on the left side.\n",
